OculuScooter is a virtual scooter simulator which uses real scooter handle and your own foot as inputs.

##Description
Our main source of inspiration was a friend of ours who gets heavy motion sickness from virtual reality (VR) applications. We had heard from Professor LaValle that a user is less likely to get motion sickness if the VR application moves as a direct result of the user's physical movement. A good example of this is the Birdly flying simulator which allows a user to fly through the scene like a bird by flapping his arms as if they were wings.

We had a spare pair of roller skates that we wanted to use for as an input to a VR application. Initially, we were thinking of walking simulations, but quickly decided it would not be very exciting. As we continued brainstorming, we looked through Dick's catalogue of sporting devices and spotted scooters. Everyone on our team immediately agreed to build a scooter simulator and we zoomed down to Dick's and Home Depot first thing in the morning on Saturday.
